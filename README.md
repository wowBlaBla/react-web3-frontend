# chain
I've deployed the SD.sol on ropsten

# config
I stored the contractABI and contractAddr in config.js file
You can find out the config.js file here
./src/config.js

# start
1. npm install
2. npm start

* Note: I also displayed the owner of SD contract to confirm my frontend works well.

That's all.
Thanks in advance.
